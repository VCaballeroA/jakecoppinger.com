        <p>While computers in recent years have become far more powerful, the ways of interacting with them haven't changed greatly since the beginning - keyboards, mice, and lately touch screens. The new field of wearable technology has exploded in the last 5 years, but these old forms of human computer interaction are not practical for these mobile systems. Swirlesque is a new form of human-computer interaction which can recognise natural gestures and performs actions. It is suited to 'always on' systems because it ‘disappears’ when in use -- the best interface is no interface. The form of interaction is an extension of a natural form of human communication, hand gestures, which are instinctively easy to remember. It can communicate with an Android phone app, and because smart phones have an ever-present internet connection, it can interact with the world through the ‘internet of things’.</p>

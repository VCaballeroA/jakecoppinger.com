##**[departing.io](http://www.departing.io)** is a web application designed to answer one question, and answer it well:
##*“when will the next bus come?”*


### Philosophy
While the software for planning trips is well established (such as Google Maps) I found it was still a chore to find when the next bus would arrive. The LED screens at major bus stations are helpful but they may only show 5 buses at a time - which may not include the one you are looking for. I created Designless.io for the sole purpose of finding when the next bus on a route will depart from a given stop.

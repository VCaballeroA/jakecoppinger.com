Beginning to shoot film on your DSLR? This tutorial goes over some practical tips on creating a cinematic look with your DSLR footage. In this video I cover the basic camera settings to achieve a popular style and some effective editing techniques to begin with. Have a read of the comments - some much more qualified people have shared their useful tips!

Something I did not mention is that you can use a neutral-density filter to reduce amount of light entering the camera. This will allow you to shoot with a wide aperture in bright daylight while keeping the exposure correct.

While I mentioned you could overlay an image with black bars to make a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, some filmmakers in the comments suggested it's better to make the project itself the correct ratio so that films display better on ultra-widescreen displays (they are 100% right). You can change this in the composition settings or in the export settings in premiere - for 1080p footage the resolution will then be 1920x810 pixels (rather than 1920x1080).

        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>While the software for planning trips is well established (such as Google Maps) I found it was still a chore to find when the next bus would arrive. The LED screens at major bus stations are helpful but they may only show 5 buses at a time - which may not include the one you are looking for. I created Designless.io for the sole purpose of finding when the next bus on a route will depart from a given stop.</p>
